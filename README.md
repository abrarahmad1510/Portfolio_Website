# Guided Walkthough of AbrarisLive 
Hi Everyone, I am Abrar, a sophomore CS major at the University of Waterloo and 
this is the guided walkthrough of my personal portfolio website - AbrarisLive,
Something that I have been working on since a long time. The project tells a little about 
myself :), key working experiences I've had over the years with working at larger firms
such as Uber, Augurs, Outlier AI and the University of Waterloo itself while studying CS
in my second year. 

The website opens up with a welcome message for you for coming on my webiste, followed by being 
directed to the home page displaying a brief description about who Abrar is and what defines and 
motivates him to keep working in Software. Below that is the Experience Section where I expect you to 
play cards with my experiences, flipping through and seeing whats hidden at the back of each card. 
Once done with that, we move to the professional proficiencies section - cool way to name Certifications.
This is where you will find the certifications I have obtained, working on and the ones I plan on 
completing within the next three months. Click on the cool hyperlinks to view those and leave a feedback 
as to how the transitions are.

In case, you are still with me in this tour, we now come to my favourite place which is the Project 
Galery much like the Art Gallery in modern musuems. This is where you will find all my projects, some
I am working on and who all alongside me have put life in these projects. You can hover around all the 
projects, click on the one who you want to see a detailed description and check out some links 
to see the work we have for that particular project. Some of my favourites I worked on are DriveMate AI 
and DroneRoad Navigation but feel free to dm me your favourite too as that helps. 

Finally, its the last section for sending a customised message directly to me through the message box 
which could be replaced by sending me a dm directly on linkedin or through mail. 

For curious minds, I have used the following for my portfolio:
1) Front End: React, Vite, HTML, Tailwind CSS and Javascript
2) Back End: Supabase and MYSQL
3) Deployment: Vercel App
